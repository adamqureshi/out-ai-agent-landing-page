# OUT AI Agent landing page (static)

This repo is a **static landing page** template for OnlyUsedTesla.ai / OUT AI Agent.

## What's included
- Hero section
- Demo selection (Chat AI Agent + Voice AI Agent)
- Contact Sales section (split layout like ElevenLabs) with a simple multi-step form (front-end only)
- Chat demo drawer (front-end only)
- Voice demo modal (browser speech features where supported)

## Deploy
Host anywhere static:
- GitHub Pages
- Azure Static Web Apps
- Azure Storage static website
- etc.

## Backend wiring (later)
Your developer can wire:
- the **contact form** to an Azure Function / API endpoint
- the **chat demo** and **voice demo** to your real AI service

For now, the form logs payload to the browser console and shows a success state.
